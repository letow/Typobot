# Typobot
A Telegram bot for typographing posts in your channel (based on Russian [typograf.ru](https://typograf.ru/) API).

## Instruction

1. You have to download the script **typograf.py** from the repo.
2. Then, create a Telegram bot (using BotFather) and get its token. There are a lot of manuals on the internet, you won't get lost.
3. Create a new text file in the same folder you saved **typograf.py** in, and paste the token without any spaces and other symbols.
4. Add bot to your Telegram channel as an admin and launch **typograf.py** (Python 3.x and its libraries [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) and [pyTelegramBotAPI](https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI) need to be installed).
5. Go ahead and post something. The bot will *typograf* it.
